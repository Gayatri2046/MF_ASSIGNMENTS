/*Write a program to implement set operations to manage membership in school clubs. A school has two clubs: the Drama Club and the Science Club.
Set A={students in the Drama Club}     ,         Set B={students in the Science Club}
Perform following tasks :
● Find Students in at least one club.
● Find Students in both clubs.
● Find students in the Drama Club but not in the Science Club.   Find Students in the Science Club but not in the Drama Club.
● If a student is not a member of any club*/
